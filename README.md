# Symbar - Your personalized shortcut to symbols and accents!
Symbar is a browser extension that allows users to easily access symbols and accents from a toolbar on any web page. It also provides the ability to add custom symbols and accents to the toolbar, making it a personalized tool for users. This project is a clone of the [CopyThat](https://github.com/mh-anwar/CopyThat) project.

## Features
Symbol and Accent Toolbar
Symbar provides a toolbar that can be accessed on any web page. The toolbar includes a wide range of symbols and accents that can be easily be copied into a user's clipboard just by clicking on them. This saves users the hassle of searching for specific symbols or accents online. Instead, if the user needs to find a specific symbol they can search directly from the toolbar.

## Custom Symbols and Accents
Symbar also allows users to add their own custom symbols and accents to the toolbar. This feature makes it a flexible tool for users who frequently use certain symbols or accents that are not included in the default toolbar. The customization goes beyond symbols too, it allows for any text that is frequently used to be added.

## Intuitive UI
To make navigation easy, dark mode  can be enabled or disabled with a single click. This feature is perfect for users who prefer a darker background while working on their computer, and helps reduce eye strain.
